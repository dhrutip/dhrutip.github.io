I'm Dhruti (she/her), an undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm an aspiring software engineer, fascinated by the intersection between technology and healthcare. Currently, I'm:

- interning at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) on Android app development
- teaching computer science to K-12 students at [Juni Learning](https://junilearning.com/)
- developing an embedded systems user interface for DARPA-backed neurotechnology startup, [Thermaquil](https://www.thermaquil.com/)
- building Computer Science Kickstart's [website](https://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu/) for incoming female UC Berkeley freshman interested in technology

In my free time, you'll find me playing badminton, making smoothies, and exploring hiking trails near me.
