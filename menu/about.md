I'm Dhruti (she/her), an undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm an aspiring software engineer, fascinated by the intersection between technology and healthcare. Currently, I'm:
- teaching data structures and algorithms to ~1500 UC Berkeley students through [CS 61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/); you can find my teaching materials on [this Notion](https://rune-hardboard-bd0.notion.site/CS-61B-Spring-2022-0b65448c3ec8472195b8d6147981d84d)!
- an incoming software engineering intern at [Meta](https://www.facebook.com/)
- building Computer Science Kickstart's [website](https://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu/) for female UC Berkeley freshman interested in technology

In the past, I've
- designed and built a [mobile app](https://rune-hardboard-bd0.notion.site/gem-4475f976cb8e46f5bfdcfed954a1472b) matching travellers to local hosts at destinations through [Facebook University](https://diversity.fb.com/initiative/facebook-university/)
- developed an embedded systems user interface for DARPA-backed neurotechnology startup, [Thermaquil](https://www.thermaquil.com/)
- taught computer science to K-12 students at [Juni Learning](https://junilearning.com/)

In my free time, you'll find me playing badminton, making smoothies, and exploring hiking trails near me.
